# AIModelIntegrationSuite

A modular, extensible suite for integrating, benchmarking, and experimenting with various Large Language Models (LLMs) — both cloud-based and local — using C# and .NET.

## 🌐 Vision

The AIModelIntegrationSuite project is designed to be a unified R&D playground and integration framework that enables seamless communication with leading AI models such as:

- 🧠 OpenAI (GPT series)
- 💻 Ollama (for local model hosting)
- 🌟 Gemma (Google)
- 🤖 Pi (Inflection)
- ⚡ Mistral
- 🐉 Qwen (Alibaba)
- 🧬 DeepSeek

As a software engineer, I aim to build a robust platform for testing AI capabilities, unifying access layers, and enabling real-world usage through abstracted service layers and clean architecture practices.
